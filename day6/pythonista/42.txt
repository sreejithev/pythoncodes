Simple is Better Than Complex

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

â€”Brian W. Kernighan, co-author of The C Programming Language and the "K" in "AWK"

In other words, keep your programs simple!
