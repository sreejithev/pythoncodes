Long Lines & Continuations
------------------------------

Keep lines below 80 characters in length.

Use implied line continuation inside parentheses/brackets/braces:

def __init__(self, first, second, third,
             fourth, fifth, sixth):
    output = (first + second + third
              + fourth + fifth + sixth)
Use backslashes as a last resort:

VeryLong.left_hand_side \
    = even_longer.right_hand_side()

Backslashes are fragile; they must end the line they're on. 
If you add a space after the backslash, it won't work any more. 
Also, they're ugly.
