Practicality Beats Purity
===========================

There are always exceptions. From PEP 8:

But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent -- 
sometimes the style guide just doesn't apply. When in doubt, use your 
best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. 
And don't hesitate to ask!

Two good reasons to break a particular rule:

When applying the rule would make the code less readable, 
even for someone who is used to reading code that follows the rules.

To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for historic reasons) 
-- although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else's mess (in true XP style).

... but practicality shouldn't beat purity to a pulp!
