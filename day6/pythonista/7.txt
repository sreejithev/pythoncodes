Long lines ...
------------------

text = ('Long strings can be made up '
        'of several shorter strings.')
The parentheses allow implicit line continuation.

Multiline strings use triple quotes:

"""Triple
double
quotes"""


'''\
Triple
single
quotes\
'''
In the last example above (triple single quotes), note how the backslashes are used to escape the newlines. 
This eliminates extra newlines, while keeping the text and quotes nicely left-justified. 
The backslashes must be at the end of their lines.
