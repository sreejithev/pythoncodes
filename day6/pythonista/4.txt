Whitespace - 2
-----------------

Add a space after "," in dicts, lists, tuples, & argument lists, and after ":" in dicts, but not before.
Put spaces around assignments & comparisons (except in argument lists).
No spaces just inside parentheses or just before argument lists.
No spaces just inside docstrings.

def make_squares(key, value=0):
    """Return a dictionary and a list..."""
    d = {key: value}
    l = [key, value]
    return d, l
